# l2code

Learning/Teaching Java with friends.

## Layout:

- Lessons will encompass a particular topic and include a quiz and a small project.
- Projects will encompass a set of topics and get you into the programmer frame of mind.
- Interviews are meant to prepare you to get a job. I recommend staying out of this module and having someone who has already done the interviews to run you through them when you're ready.
