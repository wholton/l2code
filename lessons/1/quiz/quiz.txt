1. Describe the following primitive variable types and their uses.
	- char
	- int
	- long
	- double
	- boolean

2. Write some example code using operators on primitive variables.

3. How can you shorten "x = x + 3;"?

4. What is the value of "result" at line 2 and 4?
	int x = 5 * 3 - 4;
	boolean result = x > 10 && x < 20 || x == -5;
	x *= 2;
	result &= x >= -10 || x <= 30;

5. What is the value of ac? (hint: search for articles/videos about what ASCII is)
	char ac = 'A' + 1;

6. Why doesn't the following work?
	int x = 2000;
	long y = x;
	x = y;

7. What is the value of y?
	double x = 10.5;
	int y = 0;
	y += x;

8. Why doesn't this work?
	int x = 3;
	int y = 4;
	int x = 5;

9. Why doesn't this work?
	int x = 1;
	int y;
	int x *= y;

10. Can you define a variable without a type?

11. What is the JVM? What is the benefit of it?

12. Describe how Java code is executed on a computer. You do not have to be super detailed, but you should cover the major steps.
